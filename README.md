MindYOLO is [MindSpore Lab](https://github.com/mindspore-lab)'s software system that implements state-of-the-art YOLO series algorithms, [support list and benchmark](MODEL_ZOO.md). It is written in Python and powered by the [MindSpore](https://mindspore.cn/) deep learning framework.

The master branch works with **MindSpore 1.8.1**.

## What is New 
- 2023/03/30
1. Currently, the models supported by the first release include the basic specifications of YOLOv3/YOLOv5/YOLOv7;
2. Models can be exported to MindIR/AIR format for deployment.
3. ⚠️ The current version is based on the static shape of GRAPH. The dynamic shape of the PYNATIVE will be added later. Please look forward to it.
4. ⚠️ The current version only supports the Ascend platform, and the GPU platform will support it later.

## Benchmark and Model Zoo

Seed [MODEL ZOO](MODEL_ZOO.md).

## Installation

### Dependency

- mindspore >= 1.8.1
- numpy >= 1.17.0
- pyyaml >= 5.3
- openmpi 4.0.3 (for distributed mode)

To install the dependency, please run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MindSpore can be easily installed by following the official [instructions](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) where you can select your hardware platform for the best fit. To run in distributed mode, [openmpi](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.0/) is required to install.

The following instructions assume the desired dependency is fulfilled.
