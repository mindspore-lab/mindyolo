## Abstract
YOLOv7 surpasses all known object detectors in both speed and accuracy in the range from 5 FPS to 160 FPS and has the highest accuracy 56.8% AP among all known real-time object detectors with 30 FPS or higher on GPU V100. YOLOv7-E6 object detector (56 FPS V100, 55.9% AP) outperforms both transformer-based detector SWIN-L Cascade-Mask R-CNN (9.2 FPS A100, 53.9% AP) by 509% in speed and 2% in accuracy, and convolutional-based detector ConvNeXt-XL Cascade-Mask R-CNN (8.6 FPS A100, 55.2% AP) by 551% in speed and 0.7% AP in accuracy, as well as YOLOv7 outperforms: YOLOR, YOLOX, Scaled-YOLOv4, YOLOv5, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO-5scale-R50, ViT-Adapter-B and many other object detectors in speed and accuracy. Moreover, we train YOLOv7 only on MS COCO dataset from scratch without using any other datasets or pre-trained weights.

#### Notes

- Context: Training context denoted as {device}x{pieces}-{MS mode}, where mindspore mode can be G - graph mode or F - pynative mode with ms function. For example, D910x8-G is for training on 8 pieces of Ascend 910 NPU using graph mode.
- Box mAP: Accuracy reported on the validation set.
- We refer to the official [YOLOV7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) to reproduce the P5 series model, and the differences are as follows:
  1. We use 8x NPU(Ascend910) for training, and the single-NPU batch size for tiny/l/x is 16/16/12. This is different from the official code.

## Quick Start

Please refer to the [GETTING_STARTED](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindyolo/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) in MindYOLO for details.

### Training

<details open>

#### - Distributed Training

It is easy to reproduce the reported results with the pre-defined training recipe. For distributed training on multiple Ascend 910 devices, please run
```shell
# distributed training on multiple GPU/Ascend devices
mpirun -n 8 python train.py --config ./configs/yolov7/yolov7.yaml --device_target Ascend --is_parallel True
```
> If the script is executed by the root user, the `--allow-run-as-root` parameter must be added to `mpirun`.

Similarly, you can train the model on multiple GPU devices with the above mpirun command.

For detailed illustration of all hyper-parameters, please refer to [config.py](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindyolo/blob/master/mindyolo/utils/config.py).

**Note:**  As the global batch size  (batch_size x num_devices) is an important hyper-parameter, it is recommended to keep the global batch size unchanged for reproduction or adjust the learning rate linearly to a new global batch size.

#### - Standalone Training

If you want to train or finetune the model on a smaller dataset without distributed training, please run:

```shell
# standalone training on a CPU/GPU/Ascend device
python train.py --config ./configs/yolov7/yolov7.yaml --device_target Ascend
```

</details>

### Validation and Test

To validate the accuracy of the trained model, you can use `test.py` and parse the checkpoint path with `--weight`.

```
python test.py --config ./configs/yolov7/yolov7.yaml --device_target Ascend --weight /PATH/TO/WEIGHT.ckpt
```
